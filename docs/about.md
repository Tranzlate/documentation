## Why?

Tranzlate was created to ease the difficulties and tedious process when dealing with localization. Copying text back and forth from Excel sheets is error-prone and not scaleable. Tranzlate attempts to improve the experience when localizing an application, whether it be a web or native application.

## Goal

Help any project add support for multiple languages and regions.
