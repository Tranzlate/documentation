# Tranzlate Documentation

This website is a collection of documentation for Tranzlate and its API. It is meant to be used as a reference. It is incomplete but planned to be updated regularly.

In the case that you want to run locally and contribute:

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
